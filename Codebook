## Code Book

#This is the code book describing the data filds in tidy.txt.

# Unique IDs: activity and subject
activityID - Types of activities (1-6)
subjectID - ID of the test subject

#Activity Type
activityID  activityName
	1	        WALKING
	2	        WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3	        WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4	        SITTING
	5	        STANDING
	6	        LAYING
